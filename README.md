**PetstoreAPITest**
This is my answer to the hackerrank exam.

 - It is written in robotframework.
 - By this time I'm facing an issue with the image upload as in the report sample.
 - And this is an image of the report:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MahmoudIMahmoud/PetstoreAPITest/master/image.png
.

**Additionally**
- I put a docker file for creating the environment.
- I also added a shell script to run within docker.
- To run you just need to run: docker-compose up
